# COVID_STEM_MADA

Code used to process data from the **Impacts of Covid-19 on Malagasy STEM** project

A summary of the project from February 2021 is pasted here:

We are conducting a survey that aims at understanding how the coronavirus pandemic is affecting Malagasy women and men in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and their research activities in Madagascar. This survey is completely ANONYMOUS. The survey contains questions about general and academic information. Some of the questions ask about personal information in order to collect data on the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns. Therefore, some of these questions might be sensitive, but we ensure the CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE INFORMATION PROVIDED. We are inviting all Malagasy students at the Master's or PhD students level, researchers, and practitioners in STEM fields to complete this survey. Your participation in this research study is voluntary and will take approximately 15-30 minutes. Please feel free to share the link with other Malagasy scientists so that they can also participate. For complete information about this study, please see this link: https://sites.google.com/view/project-summary/home. If you have any questions, please contact Ms. Miary Raselimanana (miaryras@gmail.com)
